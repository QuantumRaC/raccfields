## What to know about this tool  

This is a **beta release** and **a work in progress**.  
T3xtAnlys (name still subject to change) is an experimental lightweight text analysis tool that combines traditional NLP methods (spaCy, statistical metrics, language detection) with generative AI (Google Gemini) to provide insights into writing style, word choice, grammar structures, and sentiment.  

The projectâ€™s goal is to **describe writing styles in a more statistical and quantitative way**, showing how technology can bridge hard data with more sentimental and qualitative aspects of language such as tone, emotion, and style. I originally started this project while reflecting on my own writing, curious about what NLP data of different styles might reveal. Generative AI was introduced almost as a *writing instructor* interpreting the raw statistics into human-friendly feedback. I chose to implement it for both English and Simplified Chinese because these are the two languages I write in, and as a bilingual person both are equally significant to me.

### Current limitations  
- Occasional inaccuracies in language detection, especially with mixed-language text.  
- Generative feedback may vary in quality or verbosity, depending on the input.  
- Processing large text blocks can be memory-intensive on limited hosting environments.  

This is not a production-ready system, but a demonstration of how **classical NLP** and **modern LLMs** can work together in a cohesive workflow. Feedback and contributions are welcome. The project will continue to evolve as new techniques are explored.
